# BlueHound

[BlueHound](https://github.com/zeronetworks/BlueHound) is an open-source tool that helps blue teams identify critical security issues by combining information about user permissions, network access, and unpatched vulnerabilities. BlueHound reveals the paths attackers would take if they were inside network.

## Install

We can download BlueHound's compiled version for Windows from the [github releases link](https://github.com/zeronetworks/BlueHound/releases), but we can also use it on Linux or MacOS.
