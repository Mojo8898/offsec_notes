# offsec_notes

Here are my notes offensive security notes, posted for others for use as a template in Obsidian.

To use/view, clone this repository and open it as a vault in Obsidian.

**Note:** Some notes will be flagged and potentially deleted by your antivirus software when cloning. Therefore, clone to an excluded directory for the best experience.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mojo8898/offsec_notes.git
```

**Additional Note:** ~80% of the content here has been redacted/removed altogether for obvious reasons. That being said, I have preserved most tool usage and some basic techniques/methodologies to provide a solid starting point.
