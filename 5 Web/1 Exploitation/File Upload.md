# File Upload

Refer to [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files)

**Notes:**

- Attempt changing capitalization first if attempting to bypass filters (as opposed to extension change)
- Check under different ports if multiple web pages are available and unable to find where the file has been uploaded to
